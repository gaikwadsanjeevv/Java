### Abstract Class and Concrete class  

- we write abstract before any class it is abstract class while rest other are concrete class.  
- You cannot create the object of abstract class like normal general concrete class.
- We can create reference of object in abstract.
- When we write abstract before method and has no body- undefined method is abstract method.
- So when we have atleast one abstract method then class is definately abstract.
