```Java
In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is an essential component designed to enhance the runtime performance of Java applications. Here's how it works:

Interpretation at First: When a Java program starts, the JVM initially interprets the bytecode (produced by the Java compiler) into native machine code for execution.

Hotspot Code Detection: The JVM monitors which parts of the code are executed frequently, known as "hotspots." These hotspots often include loops, frequently invoked methods, or code that repeats many times.

JIT Compilation: Instead of interpreting the hotspot code repeatedly, the JIT compiler translates these parts of the bytecode into native machine code. Once compiled, the native code is executed directly, skipping the interpretation process.

Optimization: The JIT compiler applies various runtime optimizations to the hotspot code, such as:

Inline expansion: Replacing method calls with the actual method code to reduce the overhead of method invocation.
Loop unrolling: Optimizing loops by reducing the number of iterations.
Dead code elimination: Removing code that is never executed.
Adaptive optimizations: Adjusting optimizations based on runtime conditions.
Caching: Once compiled, the native code is cached for reuse, so subsequent executions are faster.

By leveraging the JIT compiler, the JVM can balance between the flexibility of bytecode interpretation and the speed of native machine code execution, providing significant performance improvements for Java applications.
