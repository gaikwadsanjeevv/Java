- Asymptotic notation is an important tool applied to the analysis of algorithms.
- One of AN is Big O notation.

```java
class NestedLoop {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int n = 10; // O(time complexity of the called function)
		int sum = 0; //O(1)
		double pie = 3.14; //O(1)
		int var = 1;

	
		while(var < n) {  // O(log n)
			System.out.println("Pie: " + pie); // O(log n)
			
			for (int j = 0; j < var; j++) {  // 2n
				sum++;  //  (2n-1)
			}
			var *= 2; // O(log n)
		} //end of while loop
		
		System.out.println("Sum: " + sum); //O(1)
	} //end of main
} //end of class
```

What is a Stack?  
- We are all familiar with the famous Undo option, which is present in almost every application. Have you ever wondered how it works? The idea is that you store the previous states of your work (which are limited to a specific number), in the memory in such an order that the last one appears first. This canâ€™t be done just by using arrays, which is why the Stack comes in handy.  
- You can think of the Stack as a container, in which we can add items and remove them. Only the top of this container is open, so the item we put in first will be taken out last, and the items we put in last will be taken out first. This is called the last in first out (LIFO) ordering.
