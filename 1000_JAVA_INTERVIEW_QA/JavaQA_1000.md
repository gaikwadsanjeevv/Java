## Java Interview Questions  

#### 1. What is the difference between JDK and JRE?  
Ans:
  ```answer
The JDK (Java Development Kit) and JRE (Java Runtime Environment) are two essential components of the Java ecosystem, but they serve different purposes.

JDK:
It’s a software development kit used to develop Java applications.
Includes the JRE, plus development tools like the compiler (javac), debugger, and libraries for building applications.
Example use: Writing, compiling, and debugging Java code.
JRE:
It’s a runtime environment used to run Java applications.
Contains the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), core libraries (e.g., java.lang), and other components needed to execute Java bytecode.
Does not include development tools like javac.
Key Difference:

JDK = JRE + Development Tools.
If you’re a developer, you need the JDK. If you’re just running a Java app (e.g., as an end-user), the JRE is sufficient.
Why Java Introduced This?:

Java separates JDK and JRE to cater to different audiences—developers need tools, while end-users only need runtime support—optimizing resource usage and distribution.
