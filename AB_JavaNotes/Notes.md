### JAVA Complete Mastery  
##### Interpreter              and          compiler  
- Needs every time goes line by line  | need one time as it compiles the whole programme at ones.  
- Will not generate a sperate file    | Compiler will generate a seperate file.  
- JavaScript(hybrid com as well Inter)| c, c++, Java  
- When code is interpreded each line is read and converted to machine  
- code and excecuted at same time | It will compile whole file if no error it will generate its byte code.  
- Transalation and execution at same time line by line | Traslation is done once when there are no error.  
- Easy to learn but slow | Fast  
-----------------------------------  

- First.java  --> First.class(compiled into byte code by javac) --> JVM - Executes the code (Interpreter translates into machine code-slower) --> So java is hybrid language compiled as well intertreted while compiler generated the new file and interpretor wont.  

- The bytecode can run on any platform that has a compatible Java Virtual Machine (JVM), enhancing Java's "write once, run anywhere" philosophy.  

- The fact that it starts with a compilation step into bytecode is significant. Therefore, itâ€™s common to call Java a compiled language, even though its execution mechanism has hybrid traits.  

- Machine code talks to OS and can run on hardware.  
- C++ --> First.cpp --> First.exe --> OS runsa machine code on Hardware.  
- Java -->  First.java --> First.class (byte code given by javac compiler if there are no errors) --> JVM can undersand byte code and talk to OS to run it on Hardware.  
- So JVM understand bytecode so as per OS the JVM is different but can understand same byte code. JVM is platform dependent - and so makes Java platform independent.

##### JVM Architecture:

- when the class file is generated by compiler has to be loaded in main memory by class loader.
- Interpreter / JIT(compiler) - convert into machine code and get it executed by PC. Now for repeated code section JIT will compile it one time and use it for rest code interpretor is used.  
- Dynamic object are created in Heap
- when ever a method is called its stack frame is created in stack memory.  
- The variables are stored in stack and references are created in Stack itself.
