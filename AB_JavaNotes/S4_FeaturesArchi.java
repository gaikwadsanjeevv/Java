// Interpreter              and          compiler
//Needs every time goes line by line  | need one time as it compiles the whole programme at ones.
//Will not generate a sperate file    | Compiler will generate a seperate file.
//JavaScript(hybrid com as well Inter)| c, c++, Java
//When code is interpreded each line is read and converted to machine
// code and excecuted at same time | It will compile whole file if no error it will generate its byte code.
//Transalation and execution at same time line by line | Traslation is done once when there are no error.
//Easy to learn but slow | Fast
//-----------------------------------

//First.java  --> First.class(compiled into byte code by javac) --> JVM(Interpreter translates into machine code-slower) --> So java is hybrid language compiled as well intertreted while compiler generated the new file and interpretor wont.

//The bytecode can run on any platform that has a compatible Java Virtual Machine (JVM), enhancing Java's "write once, run anywhere" philosophy.

//The fact that it starts with a compilation step into bytecode is significant. Therefore, itâ€™s common to call Java a compiled language, even though its execution mechanism has hybrid traits.
